# FloodAI

## Overview

FloodAI is an intelligent flood prediction and management system that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast flood events, assess risk levels, and support emergency response efforts.

## Features

- **Flood Prediction**: Advanced ML models for accurate flood forecasting
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time analysis of flood risk in different regions
- **Data Integration**: Seamless integration with weather and hydrological data sources
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps and dashboards for flood monitoring
- **Alert System**: Timely alerts and notifications for flood warnings

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **ML/AI**: Machine Learning models for predictive analytics
- **Data Processing**: Data analysis and preprocessing tools
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and mapping tools
